I used random module, while and nested loops to make this game.

In this game, User chooses a random number and Computer have to guess the correct answer. Computer gives responses and user has to compare and give responses.

If guess is less than correct answer, User has to reply with "low"
If guess is more than correct answer, User has to reply with "high"
If your guess is correct, User has to reply with "correct"
Else, computer eventually reaches the right guess while updating the range.
